# AI Research Log

A curated documentation system for capturing and preserving valuable insights from human-AI interactions during mathematical research and AI-assisted programming work.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a living archive of meaningful exchanges with AI systems (primarily Perplexity Pro, Claude, and other platforms) that contribute to my research in mathematics, formal verification, and AI methodology. Rather than letting valuable conversations disappear, this system captures, curates, and showcases the most insightful moments where AI assists with:

- Mathematical reasoning and proof development
- Formal verification in Isabelle/HOL
- Hypercompositional algebra and algebraic structures
- Research methodology and academic workflow optimization
- AI-assisted programming techniques
- Foundation of mathematics and computational logic

## What You'll Find Here

This repository contains **curated excerpts** from AI conversations—not full transcripts, but the most intellectually substantive exchanges. Each file represents a conversation that has been processed to extract:

- Novel insights and breakthrough reasoning moments
- Methodological approaches to research problems
- Technical solutions to mathematical or programming challenges
- Meta-insights about effective AI collaboration

Routine exchanges and procedural content are filtered out, leaving only material worth preserving and revisiting.

## Repository Structure

processed/ ├── mathematics/         # Mathematical reasoning and proofs ├── formal-verification/ # Isabelle/HOL and theorem proving ├── ai-methodology/      # Meta-insights about AI collaboration └── programming/         # Code development and optimization


## Workflow

Each document in this repository follows this process:

1. **Capture**: Conversations exported from AI platforms as Markdown files
2. **Curate**: AI processes its own outputs to extract the most valuable insights
3. **Commit**: Refined Markdown files organized by topic and preserved with version control

## Philosophy

This project embodies principles of transparent, ethical AI usage in academic contexts:

- **Learning-focused**: Documenting the process of learning with AI, not just final outputs
- **Methodology over results**: Showcasing how AI tools enhance research workflows
- **Intellectual honesty**: Preserving the collaborative nature of AI-assisted work
- **Knowledge compounding**: Building a searchable knowledge base that grows more valuable over time

## Context

This repository is part of ongoing research in pure mathematics (effect algebras, valuation theory, hyperfields) while simultaneously developing expertise in AI-assisted formal verification and programming. It serves both as a personal knowledge management system and a public demonstration of effective AI collaboration in academic research.
