# Documenting AI-Assisted Research and Interaction Highlights

## Documenting Work With AI: Framework and Workflow

The attached conversation outlines a robust system for capturing and preserving valuable insights from human-AI interactions during research and programming work.

- **Core Strategy:** Combine a Personal Knowledge Management system (like Obsidian) with automated capture and processing workflows.
- **Automation:** Use tools (e.g., n8n workflow automation) to extract, tag, and organize AI conversation notes automatically into a searchable, linked database.
- **Daily Capture:** Employ CLI wrappers or browser extensions to log full AI interactions with minimal friction.
- **Processing Pipeline:** Summarize core insights, generate semantic tags, and link related content in the PKM.
- **Synthesis:** Schedule periodic AI-driven synthesis that surfaces emergent themes and contradictions.
- **Platform Integration:** Leverage Apple ecosystem automations (Shortcuts, VS Code) and GitHub for seamless version control and editing.

**Insight:** Automating documentation converts scattered conversations into intellectual capital that compounds over time, essential for rigorous AI-assisted research.
